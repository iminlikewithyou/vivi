plan:

make a command which displays a "total diff" which is the combined diff of all the diffs in the changes directory
this requires creating a get combined diff method

when running a "create release" command,
use this diff to combine this into the english.txt word list
then clear the changes directory of all the diffs
make the github release and we're all set
