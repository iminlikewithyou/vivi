# Vivi

Welcome to the (temporary) Vivi dictionary repository! Here, you can update the dictionary or open issues.

## Contributing

We are now welcoming contributions from the community to improve Vivi. If you have any suggestions, corrections, or new entries to add, please follow these steps:

### Create an issue

If you don't want to make the modification yourself, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/omg-community/vivi/issues/) and suggest what you want changed.

### Make the change yourself

If you want to take initiative (which is extremely helpful!), you can follow these steps in order to make a direct change to any of the lists or dictionaries:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. **DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE DICTIONARY ITSELF!!!**
3. Make your modifications on your new branch in the `changes` folder by adding a `.diff` file. See how to do it by reading the `example.diff` in the main directory.
4. Go back to `omg/vivi` and submit a pull request. This will create a request to pull your changes from the branch
that you created into Vivi's master branch.
